# Dead-Link-Not-Zelda
A command-line tool for finding and reporting dead links (e.g., broken URLs) in a file. 

Steps to run locally:

1) Clone the repository to a directory of your choice.
2) CD into the project folder
3) Through a preferred command line system enter `go run deadLinks.go links.txt`

Considerations

I am using links.txt to test this program. Please feel free to use your own text file with URLs.
